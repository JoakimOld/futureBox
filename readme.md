# The Box From The Future

A design prompt generator based on the imagination game ["The Thing From The Future"](http://situationlab.org/projects/the-thing-from-the-future/) by Situation Lab.

The arduino sketch combines one of each category and prints the result on an [adafruit thermal printer](https://www.adafruit.com/products/597) giving you an unique design prompt on which you can write and sketch. 

By connecting 5 switches you are able to turn each category on or off customising the prompts for specific workshops or other occasions.

If you're interested in recieving one of these prompts every day you can take a look at my twitterbot "TheBotFromTheFuture" ([@BotFromFuture](https://twitter.com/BotFromFuture)).
